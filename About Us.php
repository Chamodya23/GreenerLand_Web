				<p>Did you know, on average, one tree produces nearly 
					260 pounds of oxygen each year?
					Our dedicated agriculture 
					team will plant 
					trees on selected lands on behalf of you. Your tree 
					will be photographed and geolocated and will be shared 
					with you so as the tree grows, you can cherish the 
					memories that grow 
					with the tree and the endless benefits it provides
					 to people.</p>

				<p>The average man spends most of his lifetime working – working for survival, to provide a comfortable living for his family, for betterment of society, for upward social mobility, for own mental satisfaction & wellbeing and toward other aspirations & incentives. Once a man has passed his prime, upon introspection, he will inevitably have regrets; he will regret the risks not taken, roads not travelled, and opportunities not seized. However, at the end of the day, if his achievements outnumber regrets, then he could be considered a successful individual.

In my case, the business I have built with much love and care is one that I take great pride in: looking back, I am deeply satisfied with its journey through the years as a socially and environmentally conscious Enterprise.

With innovation at the center of our Company’s DNA, we have grown and expanded significantly over the last 22 years also accomplishing, along the way, many accolades and achievements in the local context as well as globally.

I would like to heartily thank everybody who applauded me in my success and stood by my side including my dear wife and members of staff, some whose service span over two decades; I am also grateful to the doubters because your skepticism certainly motivated me to keep trying & trying in times of failure.
