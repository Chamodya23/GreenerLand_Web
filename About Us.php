				<h2 class="headline-our">Our Moral Imperative</h2>
				<p>As we collectively face a planet increasingly in distress from climate change, deforestation, pollution, and population growth, Saving Nature is working to create a more sustainable future. <br>
                   Being the source of oxygen for humans to breathe is one of the primary benefits of planting trees. Trees have the amazing capability of absorbing the Carbon dioxide in air and letting out Oxygen during the process of photosynthesis whereby energy is produced.
                   <br>
                   As the world races to stop climate change, trees are receiving more attention for the role they play in cooling the climate – and for good reason! Trees absorb and store massive amounts of carbon, and unlike other carbon removal methods they don’t require expensive technology.

				<h2 class="headline">Our Message</h2>
				<p>The average man spends most of his lifetime working – working for survival, to provide a comfortable living for his family, for betterment of society, for upward social mobility, for own mental satisfaction & wellbeing and toward other aspirations & incentives. Once a man has passed his prime, upon introspection, he will inevitably have regrets; he will regret the risks not taken, roads not travelled, and opportunities not seized. However, at the end of the day, if his achievements outnumber regrets, then he could be considered a successful individual.

In my case, the business I have built with much love and care is one that I take great pride in: looking back, I am deeply satisfied with its journey through the years as a socially and environmentally conscious Enterprise.

With innovation at the center of our Company’s DNA, we have grown and expanded significantly over the last 22 years also accomplishing, along the way, many accolades and achievements in the local context as well as globally.

I would like to heartily thank everybody who applauded me in my success and stood by my side including my dear wife and members of staff, some whose service span over two decades; I am also grateful to the doubters because your skepticism certainly motivated me to keep trying & trying in times of failure.

				<p>Planting more trees is the only long-term solution to rising pollution in our cities, climate change, and 
					rapidly dwindling green cover. Most of us are aware of this and wish to help, but for a variety of reasons,
				     our good intentions do not translate into effective actions. You may not have the time, energy, 
					 or space to plant trees, for example. Alternatively, you may be unsure about which plants/trees to cultivate, 
					 how to care for them, and so on. Fortunately, we can assist you in making a positive contribution to
					a greener planet as effortlessly as purchasing online.It not only plants a tree on your behalf, but it also creates jobs and income for
					local communities and rural recipients
