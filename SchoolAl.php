					<h1>Why is planting trees important?</h1>
                    <p>Trees highly contribute to a clean environment as they improve air quality through the process of photosynthesis â€“ producing oxygen and taking in carbon dioxide. It also filters air intercepting unhealthy particles by removing dusts and absorbing pollutants like carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide and letting the rain wash them after.
