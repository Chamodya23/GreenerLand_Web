					<h1>Why is planting trees important?</h1>
                    <p>Trees highly contribute to a clean environment as they improve air quality through the process of photosynthesis – producing oxygen and taking in carbon dioxide. It also filters air intercepting unhealthy particles by removing dusts and absorbing pollutants like carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide and letting the rain wash them after.

				<h2 class="headline">What Is Deforestation?</h2>
				<p>Deforestation refers to the decrease in forest areas across the world that are lost for other uses such as agricultural croplands, urbanization, or mining activities. Greatly accelerated by human activities since 1960, deforestation has been negatively affecting natural ecosystems, biodiversity, and the climate. The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization estimates the annual rate of deforestation to be around 1.3 million km2 per decade.

				<h3 class="headline">Why Is Deforestation Happening?</h3>
				<p>Deforestation is caused by many different of sources, both human and natural. Natural processes that cause deforestation include natural forest fires and parasite-caused diseases. Human activities, however, are one of the primary causes of worldwide deforestation. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), agriculture accounted for approximately 80% of worldwide deforestation, with infrastructure projects such as roads and dams, as well as mining and urbanization, accounting for the remaining sources of deforestation

				<h2 class="headline">How to stop Deforestation?
                </h2>
				<p>There are many ways in which we can reduce deforestation. We must protect our forests. Moreover, we must mark adequate land for our farming needs. There are some laws already in place which prohibit people from unnecessary felling of trees. What needs to be done is the proper execution of the rules so that everyone abides by it. Also, stricter punishments need to be in place for violators so as to deter other people from disobeying the laws. Alternatively, people need to ensure that for every tree felled, equal numbers of trees are planted so that the balance of nature can be maintained. Summarily, it has to be a collective duty of all and just the governments alone, if we really need to reduce deforestation.</p>

				<h2 class="headline">Trees have real super powers!</h2>
				<p>When a seed of a plant or tree grow it makes the area around it greener. Also, it supports many life forms. Birds make their nests, many reptiles and animals live on it or near it.<br>
                Besides, all these many beautiful flowers, food growing on it. Moreover, many parts of trees such as roots, leaves, stem, flower, seeds, are also edible. Most importantly they never ask anything in return for their services and the gifts they give. Trees also keep the balance in the ecosystem and ecology.<br>
                To conclude, we can say that trees are very important and beneficial for every life form on earth. Without them, the survival of life on earth will become difficult and after some time every species starts to die because of lack of oxygen on the planet. So, to save our lives and to survive we have to learn the importance of trees and also have to teach our children the importance of trees.

					<h1>Let's plant trees.</h1>
                    <p>“Plant a tree today for a better tomorrow.” The significance of forest cover and tree plantation cannot be stressed upon enough, and their importance has only increased in the present scenario, with global warming and climate change being very real threats to our planet and all its inhabitants.<br>
                    Tree plantation refers to the transplantation of saplings or sowing of seeds in order to facilitate green cover and promote afforestation. Tree plantation can be a very fulfilling and fruitful activity! Not only is it good for the environment and the earth, but it is also a way in which you can help in making the world a better and cleaner place to live in, as trees help to bring down the levels of pollution.
